Sinbad - (Automated Structure Inference and Binding of Data)
============================================================

Sinbad is a software library that makes it very easy to
uniformly access online data sources provided in standard
formats (CSV, JSON, XML). For more info, please visit:

Example
-------

Consider the following program, which connects to the
FAA live feed of airport status information:

    (require sinbad)

    (define-struct port (name loc condition delay?))

    (define faa
      (sail-to (string-append "http://services.faa.gov/airport/status/ATL")
	       (format "xml")
	       (param "format" "application/xml")
	       (cache-timeout 300)  ; refresh every 5 minutes
	       (load)))

    (fetch faa (make-port "Name" "State" "Weather/Weather" "Delay"))


Running this program should produce a value like:

    (make-port "Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International" "Georgia" "Fair" #false)
